This project uses a large, multi-center clinical trial involving patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer. Researchers used CT-PET scans to monitor the tumor size before and after combined chemotherapy and radiation treatment. The dataset include  clinical records, demographic info and medical images from 242 participants. The goal is to use this multimodal dataset to build a pipeline and AI model to enable automatic tumor diagnosis and predict survival outcome.
